      <h1>Hi, I'm John Christian Esmejarda</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is John Christian O. Esmejarda (although you can simply call me John!), and I'm a computer science student here at Laguna State Polytechnic University who is totally hooked on everything technology-related. Whether coding, debugging notoriously stubborn system problems, or geeking out about the latest trends and gadgets, I'm fully on board!..</p>
      <p>Currently, I'm deep into web development, data structures, and networking, developing projects that challenge me to learn something new each day. From creating basic websites to experimenting with multimedia arts, I enjoy bringing ideas to life as actual, working solutions—even if it means Googling way too many error codes in the process.

        I'm currently still in school, but I've already gotten my hands dirty with personal projects and schoolwork. My goal? To continue leveling up my skills, take on exciting challenges, and ultimately find a position where I can leverage tech to make a real impact.
        
        When I'm not stuck to my laptop debugging code or studying for tests, you can find me lost in a game or playing my guitar (badly, but with gusto).
        
        This portfolio is a look at my tech journey so far—check it out, and let's get in touch if you want to talk coding, opportunities, or just geek out over the latest tech advancements!</p>
